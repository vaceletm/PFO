== Definitions ==

* Capacity: a capacity is the ability to do something (read, admin,
  write, ...). A capacity is generally associated to a Ressource
  Example: read, write, admin, grant

* Ressource: a concrete thing we want to interact with. The level of
  interaction authorized is defined by the Capacity we have on the
  given Ressource.
  Example: project #123, site, doc item #33, ยง4 of wiki

* Role: a role is:
  * A collection of capacities for a set of ressource
  * A list of users

  Example: Developer is a role
  Developer has
  * [write] capacity on [svn of project #123])
  * [write] capacity on [root folder of project #123]
  John and Marcel are Developers:
  * John can [write] [svn of project #123]
  * Marcel can [write] [root folder of project #123]

== Brainstorm ==
* If we manage only roles at RBAC_Engine level it will be a major performance issue
** Need to crawl all defined roles for a user, so need to get all roles (in all projects, what if I have 10 roles (groupes) in 50 projects).
** Would be much more efficient just to test the user capacity in this case
